# Data Sources and APIs

To retrieve the necessary data for the analytics dashboard, we will be using the Firestore database and making appropriate queries and API calls. Here is an example of how you can retrieve data from Firestore using the Firestore JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/firestore';

// Initialize Firebase
const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase configuration
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Get a reference to the Firestore database
const db = firebase.firestore();

// Retrieve data from Firestore
const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const snapshot = await db.collection('data').get();
    const data = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.data());
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving data:', error);
    return [];
  }
};

export default getData;
```

In this example, we first import the necessary Firebase modules and initialize the Firebase app with your Firebase configuration. Then, we get a reference to the Firestore database using `firebase.firestore()`. We can then use this reference to make queries and retrieve data from Firestore.

The `getData` function is an example of how you can retrieve data from Firestore. It uses the `get` method to retrieve all documents from the "data" collection and maps over the resulting `snapshot` to extract the data from each document. The retrieved data is then returned as an array.

You can customize this code to fit your specific data structure and query requirements. For example, you can add filters, sorting, or pagination to the query to retrieve specific subsets of data.

Remember to handle errors appropriately when retrieving data from Firestore. In the example above, we catch any errors that occur during the data retrieval process and log them to the console.

This is just a basic example to get you started. You can refer to the Firestore documentation for more information on how to work with Firestore and make more complex queries and API calls.

Make sure to import the necessary Firebase and Firestore modules in your `analytics.tsx` file and use the appropriate queries and API calls to retrieve the data you need for your analytics dashboard.
