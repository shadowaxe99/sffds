# Design Document

## Layout
The analytics dashboard will have a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. It will consist of multiple components arranged in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

The main layout of the analytics dashboard will be divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the performance metrics. The sections will be organized in a grid-like structure, allowing users to easily navigate and analyze the data.

## Components
The analytics dashboard will include the following components:

1. Header: The header component will display the title of the analytics dashboard and provide navigation options to switch between different sections or views.

2. Overview: The overview component will provide a summary of the key performance metrics, such as total revenue generated, engagement rate, and conversion rate. It will include visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to present the data in an easily understandable format.

3. Performance Metrics: This component will display detailed performance metrics for specific time periods, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. It will include visualizations, such as line charts or bar graphs, to show the trends and changes in the metrics over time.

4. Top Influencers/Brands: This component will showcase the top influencers or brands based on specific performance metrics, such as revenue generated or engagement rate. It will include a table or a list view to present the data in a tabular format.

5. Filters: The filters component will allow users to customize the data displayed on the analytics dashboard. Users will be able to filter the data based on various criteria, such as time period, influencer/brand category, or campaign type.

6. Drill-down: The drill-down component will provide users with the ability to explore the data in more detail. Users will be able to click on specific data points or sections to view additional information or insights related to that particular metric.

## Data Visualization Techniques
The analytics dashboard will utilize various data visualization techniques to present the performance metrics in a visually appealing and informative manner. Some of the techniques that will be used include:

1. Line Charts: Line charts will be used to show the trends and changes in the performance metrics over time. They will provide a visual representation of how the metrics have evolved and help users identify patterns or anomalies.

2. Bar Graphs: Bar graphs will be used to compare different performance metrics or categories. They will allow users to easily compare the values of different metrics and identify the top performers or areas of improvement.

3. Pie Charts: Pie charts will be used to represent the distribution of performance metrics across different categories. They will provide a visual breakdown of how the metrics are distributed and help users identify the dominant categories or segments.

4. Tables: Tables will be used to present detailed information about the performance metrics, such as the top influencers or brands. They will provide a tabular view of the data, allowing users to sort, filter, or search for specific information.
