# Unit Tests

To ensure the functionality and accuracy of the analytics dashboard, comprehensive unit tests have been implemented. These tests cover various aspects of the dashboard, including data retrieval, processing, visualization, and interactive features. The unit tests are written using the testing framework provided by React and Next.js.

## Running the Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the unit tests using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This command will execute all the unit tests and display the test results in the console.

## Interpreting the Test Results

The unit tests provide detailed information about the functionality and accuracy of the analytics dashboard. Each test case verifies a specific aspect of the dashboard and checks whether it behaves as expected. The test results include the following information:

- Test case description: Describes the purpose of the test case.
- Expected result: Specifies the expected outcome of the test case.
- Actual result: Displays the actual outcome of the test case.
- Pass/Fail status: Indicates whether the test case passed or failed.

When interpreting the test results, make sure to check the pass/fail status for each test case. Failed test cases indicate potential issues or bugs in the analytics dashboard. In such cases, refer to the error messages and stack traces provided in the test results to identify the source of the problem.

It is recommended to run the unit tests regularly during the development process to catch any regressions or issues early on. Additionally, writing comprehensive unit tests helps ensure the stability and reliability of the analytics dashboard.

Please refer to the project's README file for more information on running the unit tests and interpreting the test results.
