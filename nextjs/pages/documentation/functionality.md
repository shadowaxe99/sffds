# Functionality

The analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key performance metrics for the influencer-brand collaborations platform. It allows users to track and analyze their performance in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The dashboard includes various interactive features to enhance the user experience, such as filtering, sorting, and drill-down capabilities.

## Features

1. Performance Metrics: The dashboard displays key performance metrics, such as engagement rate, conversion rate, and revenue generated. These metrics are calculated based on the data retrieved from the Firestore database.

2. Data Visualization: The dashboard visualizes the performance metrics using charts, graphs, or other suitable visualization techniques. This helps users easily understand and interpret the data.

3. Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices. It adjusts its layout and components to provide an optimal viewing experience.

4. Interactive Elements: The dashboard includes interactive elements, such as dropdown menus, checkboxes, and sliders, to allow users to customize their view and analyze specific data subsets.

5. Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter and sort the data based on various criteria, such as date range, influencer category, or brand name. This helps users focus on specific data subsets and analyze them in detail.

6. Drill-Down Capabilities: Users can drill down into specific data points to get more detailed information. For example, they can click on a specific influencer or brand to view their individual performance metrics.

## User Interactions

1. Selecting Metrics: Users can select the performance metrics they want to view on the dashboard. They can choose from a predefined list of metrics or customize their own set of metrics.

2. Filtering Data: Users can apply filters to the data to narrow down the view. They can select specific date ranges, influencer categories, or brands to focus on.

3. Sorting Data: Users can sort the data based on various criteria, such as performance metrics, influencer names, or brand names. This helps users identify top performers or compare different entities.

4. Interacting with Visualizations: Users can interact with the visualizations to get more detailed information. They can hover over data points to view tooltips or click on specific elements to drill down into the data.

5. Exporting Data: Users can export the data displayed on the dashboard to various formats, such as CSV or Excel. This allows them to further analyze the data or share it with others.

## Example Code

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates the functionality of the analytics dashboard:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { getPerformanceMetrics, applyFilters, sortData } from '../utils/analyticsUtils';
import PerformanceMetricsChart from '../components/PerformanceMetricsChart';
import Filters from '../components/Filters';
import DataGrid from '../components/DataGrid';

const AnalyticsDashboard = () => {
  const [performanceMetrics, setPerformanceMetrics] = useState([]);
  const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState([]);
  const [sortCriteria, setSortCriteria] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Retrieve performance metrics from Firestore database
    const metrics = getPerformanceMetrics();
    setPerformanceMetrics(metrics);
    setFilteredData(metrics);
  }, []);

  const handleFilterChange = (filters) => {
    // Apply filters to the data
    const filtered = applyFilters(performanceMetrics, filters);
    setFilteredData(filtered);
  };

  const handleSortChange = (criteria) => {
    // Sort the data based on the selected criteria
    const sorted = sortData(filteredData, criteria);
    setFilteredData(sorted);
    setSortCriteria(criteria);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Analytics Dashboard</h1>
      <PerformanceMetricsChart data={filteredData} />
      <Filters onChange={handleFilterChange} />
      <DataGrid data={filteredData} sortCriteria={sortCriteria} onSortChange={handleSortChange} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AnalyticsDashboard;
```

In this example, the `AnalyticsDashboard` component fetches the performance metrics from the Firestore database and initializes the state variables. It also provides callbacks for handling filter and sort changes. The component renders the performance metrics chart, filters, and data grid components based on the filtered and sorted data.

Please note that this is just a simplified example to illustrate the functionality. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and design of the analytics dashboard.
